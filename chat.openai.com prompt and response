time space matrix fortran 77 runnable code
ChatGPT

Creating a time-space matrix in Fortran 77 involves a few steps. First, you'll need to define the dimensions of your matrix, then initialize it, and finally, fill it with the relevant data representing time and space points.

Here's a basic example of how you might implement this in Fortran 77. This example assumes a simple 2D matrix where one dimension represents time and the other represents space. The exact details might vary depending on your specific requirements.

fortran

      PROGRAM TimeSpaceMatrix
      INTEGER, PARAMETER :: timeSize = 10
      INTEGER, PARAMETER :: spaceSize = 10
      DOUBLE PRECISION matrix(timeSize, spaceSize)
      INTEGER i, j

C     Initialize the matrix
      DO i = 1, timeSize
         DO j = 1, spaceSize
            matrix(i, j) = 0.0D0
         END DO
      END DO

C     Fill the matrix with your data
C     Example: matrix(i, j) = i*j (or any function of i and j)
      DO i = 1, timeSize
         DO j = 1, spaceSize
            matrix(i, j) = DOUBLE(i * j)  ! Replace with your function
         END DO
      END DO

C     Print the matrix (optional)
      DO i = 1, timeSize
         WRITE(*,*) (matrix(i, j), j = 1, spaceSize)
      END DO

      END

This code does the following:

    Defines a 2D matrix matrix with dimensions timeSize x spaceSize.
    Initializes the matrix with zeros.
    Fills the matrix with values. In this example, I used a simple multiplication of the indices i and j, but you should replace this with whatever function represents your time-space data.
    Optionally prints the matrix to the output.

To run this code:

    Save it in a file with a .f or .for extension.
    Compile it using a Fortran 77 compiler, like gfortran.
    Run the compiled executable.

Remember that Fortran 77 has specific formatting requirements, like starting code from the seventh column and having comments indicated by a C in the first column. Make sure your code adheres to these standards.
